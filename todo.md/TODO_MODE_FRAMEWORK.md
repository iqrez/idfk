## üî• Critical Priority - Mode Framework Restructuring

### Missing Core Mode Implementation
- [ ] **Create MouseKeyboardMode**: Direct mouse/keyboard input (no controller mapping)
- [ ] **Update Enums.cs**: Add `MouseKeyboard` to InputMode enum
- [ ] **Implement IModeHandler**: MouseKeyboardMode with proper input handling
- [ ] **Register in ModeManager**: Wire MouseKeyboardMode into mode switching system

### Three-Mode System Integration
- [ ] **Fix mode transitions**: MouseKeyboard ‚Üî ControllerOutput ‚Üî ControllerPassthrough
- [ ] **Update ModeController**: Support three-way mode cycling
- [ ] **Fix input suppression**: MouseKeyboard (false), ControllerOutput (true), ControllerPassthrough (false)
- [ ] **Update UI indicators**: Show all three modes in tray/overlay status

### Mode Switching Logic
- [ ] **Smart auto-switching**: Auto-switch to ControllerPassthrough when physical controller connects
- [ ] **Fallback handling**: Default to MouseKeyboard mode on system errors
- [ ] **Mode persistence**: Remember last used mode per session
- [ ] **Hotkey integration**: Global hotkeys for instant three-way mode switching

## ‚ö° High Priority - Framework Improvements

### State Management
- [ ] **Enhanced validation**: Validate transitions between all three modes
- [ ] **Resource cleanup**: Proper disposal when switching modes
- [ ] **Error recovery**: Robust error handling and mode rollback
- [ ] **Thread safety**: Ensure safe concurrent mode operations

### UI Integration
- [ ] **Mode selector widget**: Quick three-way mode picker in compact forms
- [ ] **Visual mode indicators**: Clear current mode display in all UI elements
- [ ] **Status synchronization**: Ensure UI reflects actual mode state
- [ ] **Mode-specific settings**: Per-mode configuration options

## üîß Technical Debt & Performance
- [ ] **Refactor duplicate code**: Between regular and compact forms
- [ ] **Standardize event handling**: Consistent patterns across forms
- [ ] **Improve logging**: Consistent logging across mode framework
- [ ] **Add proper disposal**: All forms and mode handlers
- [ ] **Document architecture**: Complete mode framework documentation
- [ ] **Async mode switching**: Non-blocking mode transitions
- [ ] **Input latency reduction**: Minimize delay during mode changes
- [ ] **Memory management**: Prevent leaks during frequent switches

## üé® Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Profile-based modes**: Different mode preferences per application
- [ ] **Conditional switching**: Auto-switch based on active window
- [ ] **Mode presets**: Save/load complete mode configurations
- [ ] **Transition feedback**: Visual/audio confirmation of mode changes
- [ ] Add dark/light theme support
- [ ] Implement form docking/undocking
- [ ] Add multi-monitor support for form positioning
- [ ] Create form layout presets
- [ ] Add form state persistence across sessions

## üìä Current Framework Status
- ‚úÖ **ControllerOutputMode**: Mouse/keyboard ‚Üí virtual controller (WORKING)
- ‚úÖ **ControllerPassthroughMode**: Physical controller ‚Üí virtual controller (WORKING)
- ‚ùå **MouseKeyboardMode**: Direct mouse/keyboard input (MISSING)
- ‚úÖ **ModeManager**: Thread-safe switching framework (WORKING)
- ‚úÖ **ModeService**: State persistence and validation (WORKING)

**Critical Issue**: Framework is well-architected but incomplete - missing fundamental MouseKeyboard mode for direct input without controller mapping.
